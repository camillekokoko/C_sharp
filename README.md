# C# Language Exercises

fun story on both company and employee side:
C# technologies are fast: A software company called Raygun built their application using Node.js, a framework for JavaScript. When their app started to slow down, they switched to .NET, a framework for C#. Their performance skyrocketed. As CEO John Daniel puts it, “using the same size server, we were able to go from 1,000 requests per second…with Node.js, to 20,000 requests per second with .NET Core.” In other words, they increased throughput by 2,000%.
This repository contains a collection of C# language exercises.

C# is employable: Thanks to good design and the popularity of frameworks supporting the language, C# can get you access to a lot of great jobs. Search on any job site and you’ll find companies looking for C# and .NET developers to build chat applications, financial trading programs, medical record systems, and beyond.
